        <p>I am Joseph i live 20street sinkor with my parents 
            i have few brother and sister, i am a christian, i attending  the calvary baptist church, i 
            just got my high school documents which is the calvary baptist church school system.
            i love programming because it is base on solving problem and also make you think how to solve those 
            problem with in the country, life, ans so. i want to be part of those who will change the 
            world and life.
            I will spend more time looking and trying to figure out a piece of software instead of actually using it. I look at the UI and front-end and wonder the code behind it. I wonder what programming language runs the backend. I examine it and wonder if there are some AI algorithms running in the software. Programmers are curious people. Being one, I always want to know everything.  Instead of having fun using a piece of software, I will rather navigate through it and try to imagine the
            lines of code which makes it function.s
